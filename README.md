=============

codeigniter 2.1.4 coupled with xajax in HMVC



This application is an extension of the latest version codeigniter 2.1.4, edited for HMVC structure (lent to the wiredesignz in https://bitbucket.org/wiredesignz/codeigniter-modular-extensions-hmvc), all coupled with the easy php library Ajax.

All already configured and ready to use, a native module welcome, and a module COPYTHIS to duplicate for each module to create. The COPYTHIS module includes a model that is based on the work of David Connelly, and was slightly modified.

The URL rewrite system is already activated thanks to the . Htaccess file, and form_validation bug has been fixed.

Great Enjoy!
